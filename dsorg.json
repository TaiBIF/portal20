Responding to changes in the organization of the Council of Agriculture (COA), and until an \"Agency of Forest and Nature Conservation\" has been established, the Bureau's provincial organizational rules and provincial organizational chart were revised on November 22, 2006, adding a new Conservation Division responsible for implementing various conservation services. The Protection Forest Section was originally under the Watershed Management Division and dealt with the control of forest land use and forest protection, which belongs to a part of forestry administration. In order to enhance administrative efficiency and overall executive effectiveness, the Forestry Bureau planned to move the section\u2019s works to the Forest Administration Division during the Executive Yuan\u2019s readjustment of business scope. As the date of readjustment was undecided, the Protection Forest Section\u2019s works were still transferred to the Forest Administration Division from January 1, 2012, for the purpose to achieve a multiplier effect. Under the Bureau are also eight Forest District Offices, and the Aerial Survey Office bears responsibility for surveying forest resources and map-making. Forest District Offices and the Aerial Survey Office are under the Bureau's direct control. To facilitate public access to services, the Bureau's district offices are located in major cities and towns close to national forest lands. Office headquarters contain four sections and four offices. The Ranger Stations have been established in locations where the most services are needed, and are under the management of District Offices. Ranger Stations are the Bureau's front-line implementing units; there is a total of 34 Ranger Stations and one Coastal Forest Ranger Station organized as a mission task force. In addition, the Chiayi Forest District Office is in charge of the 72-kilometer-long Alishan Forest Railway; as a result, apart from its normal sections and offices, this Office also contains a Forest Railway Management Section. In view of the Alishan Forest Railway as a national precious cultural asset, it must be reserved sustainably. The Forestry Bureau signed a contract with the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA), Ministry of Transportation and Communications, requesting the TRA to assist the operation of the forest railway and maintain traffic and passenger safety.", "country_code": "TW"}}, {"model": "data.datasetorganization", "pk": 8, "fields": {"name": "Taiwan Forestry Research Institute", "description": "Taiwan Forestry Research Institute", "country_code": "TW"}}, {"model": "data.datasetorganization", "pk": 9, "fields": {"name": "SADC Plant Genetic Resources Centre", "description": "Regional Centre for the Southern African Development Community - SADC that conserves and promotes sustainable utilization of plant genetic resources from 16 Member States of SADC.", "country_code": "ZM"}}, {"model": "data.datasetorganization", "pk": 10, "fields": {"name": "Ministry of Science and Technology", "description": "The Ministry of Science and Technology is a dedicated scientific and technological development agency, the NSC was charged with three main missions of promoting the nation\u2019s overall S&T development, supporting academic research, and developing the science parks.", "country_code": "TW"}}, {"model": "data.datasetorganization", "pk": 11, "fields": {"name": "Taiwan Environmental Information Association", "description": "We organized the Reef Check in Taiwan since 2009, and we have monitored many reefs around Taiwan.", "country_code": "TW"}}, {"model": "data.datasetorganization", "pk": 12, "fields": {"name": "Taiwan Black-faced Spoonbill Conservation Association", "description": "The beautiful island of Taiwan, once well-known as Formosa, has been over-developed due to industrial and economic priorities. This makes the lagoon at Cigu on the western seashore very precious for two reasons. First, more than half of the entire global population of the famous black-faced spoonbills winter at this site every year. Secondly, thousands of seagulls, snipes, and geese visit this area several times a year. The facts show that Cigu is a treasure of ecological sources. On September 27 of 1998, Tainan county Black-Faced Spoonbill Association(BFSA) was established by local, enthusiastic, young men and the fishermen who have made a living on inland seas for generations and being stronger to upgrade to Taiwan Black-faced Spoonbill Conservation Association in 2011. With love for their hometown and a passion for life, the members of this organization devoted themselves to ecological conservation and tourism development in hopes that the collected information from ecological studies would inspire young people to take an interest in the science of nature.\r\n", "country_code": "TW"}}]

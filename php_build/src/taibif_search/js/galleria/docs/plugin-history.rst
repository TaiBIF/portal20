History Plugin
======

Galleria comes with a history plugin that can be used to make permalinks of images. 
This is useful if you have one large gallery, f.ex a fullscreen theme, but it's usefulness is limited if you have more than one gallery on a page.
The History plugin is a fork of the great jQuery Address Plugin by Rostislav Hristov, adjusted fo fit Galleria.

Example usage
=============

**note:** You must include the history plugin script at ``src/plugins/galleria.history.js`` to use this plugin.

There is no need for any further initialization. As long as you include the plugin, Galleria will recognize this and automatically add permalinks to all images in the gallery.

It works in all supported browsers by adding #/[index] to the URL.
